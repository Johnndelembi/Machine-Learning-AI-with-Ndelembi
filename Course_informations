## MACHINE LEARNING AND AI WITH NDELEMBI ##
I plan on hosting a ML & AI 3 days bootcamp, 
in those days you will learn everything you need to know about machine learning and Artificial intelligence 
by the end of the bootcamp you will be able to build fully functional 
Machine learning models and pipelines.

Venue: Google Meet
Day and Date: July 26th - July 28th 2000hrs - 2200hrs

### WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE ###
-   Your computer/laptop with python3 already installed

NOTE: As attendies who will be taking this class, you are expected to know your way around Python 
     syntax as this session will be focused on machine learning and AI only 
     and wont be covering data analysis basics.   

### LIBRARIES TO BE STUDIES AND USED ###
- Sklearn/Scikit-learn
    1. brief explanations on data munipulations and data wrangling proceedures 
    2. preprocessing
    3. Label Encoding
    4. Training and testing using various ML algorithms i.e Decision Tree Regresor, Random Forest Regressor
    5. Checking for efficiency, accuracy and model perfomance.

### COVERAGE: ###
To be announced

### LEARNING MODE ###
My method of teaching is project based, we will be building a project as the bootcamp goes on while leaarning concepts along the way,  
each attendie is expected to build also, at the end of the program attendies will be asked to show their projects.
