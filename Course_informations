## MACHINE LEARNING AND AI WITH NDELEMBI
I plan on hosting a ML & AI 3 days bootcamp, in those days you will learn everything you need to know about machine learning and Artificial intelligence by the end of the bootcamp you will be able to build fully functional Machine learning models and pipelines only with a payment plan of TZS35,000.

Venue: To be announced
Day and Date: July (Date to be announced)

### NOTE: 
As attendies who will be taking this class, you are expected to know your way around Python syntax and fluent in ways of data analysis (munipulation and data visualization) as this session will be focused on machine learning and AI only and wont be covering data analysis basics.   

### LIBRARIES TO BE STUDIES AND USED
- Sklearn/Scikit-learn
    1. brief explanations on data munipulations and data wrangling proceedures 
    2. preprocessing
    3. Label Encoding
    4. Training and testing using various ML algorithms i.e Decision Tree Regresor, Random Forest Regressor
    5. Checking for efficiency, model perfomance.

- Pytorch
- Tensorflow

### COVERAGE:
To be announced

### LEARNING MODE
My method of teaching is project based, we will be building a project as the bootcamp goes on while leaarning concepts along the way,  each attendie is expected to build also, at the end of the program attendies will be asked to show their projects.
